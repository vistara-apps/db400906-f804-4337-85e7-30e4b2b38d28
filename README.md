2. Run the SQL schema from `supabase-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
3. Add your Supabase credentials to `.env.local`

### 4. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Open in Browser
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Creating Tasks
1. Click the microphone button on the Voice tab
2. Speak your task naturally: "Remind me to buy groceries tomorrow at 5 PM"
3. The AI will parse your speech and create a structured task
4. Tasks automatically get due dates, priorities, and descriptions
5. Contextual reminders are automatically created based on due dates and priority

### Scheduling Events
1. Use the voice input to schedule events
2. Say something like: "Schedule a meeting with John next Tuesday at 2 PM for one hour"
3. The system will create a calendar event with proper timing
4. Automatic reminders are set (15 minutes and 1 hour before events)

### AI Task Prioritization
1. Go to the Tasks tab
2. Click the "AI Prioritize" button (‚ú® icon)
3. The AI will analyze your tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix
4. Tasks will be reordered by importance and urgency
5. Priority levels will be updated automatically

### Managing Items
- View all tasks in the Tasks tab with AI-powered prioritization
- Check off completed tasks
- View upcoming events in the Calendar tab with smart reminders
- Delete items by hovering and clicking the trash icon

## Voice Commands Examples

### Tasks
- "Remind me to call mom tonight"
- "I need to finish the project report by Friday"
- "Don't forget to take out the trash tomorrow morning"
- "Buy milk and eggs when I have time" (low priority)
- "URGENT: Submit the proposal by 3 PM today" (high priority)

### Events
- "Schedule a dentist appointment next Monday at 10 AM"
- "Meeting with the team tomorrow at 2 PM in the conference room"
- "Lunch with Sarah on Friday at noon at the Italian restaurant"
- "Call with client at 4 PM today"

## üèó Architecture

### Core Components
- `VoiceInput`: Handles audio recording and AI processing
- `TaskList`: Displays and manages tasks with prioritization
- `CalendarView`: Shows upcoming events with reminders
- `MicButton`: Voice recording interface with visual feedback

### Services & Libraries
- `StorageService`: Unified data layer (Supabase + localStorage fallback)
- `AITaskPrioritizer`: Intelligent task prioritization using AI
- `ContextualReminderService`: Smart reminder system
- `api/transcribe`: Voice-to-text conversion endpoint
- `api/parse`: Natural language processing endpoint
- `api/frame`: Farcaster Frame integration

### Database Schema
The app uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with:
- **Users**: Profile and authentication data
- **Tasks**: To-do items with priorities and due dates
- **Calendar Events**: Scheduled events with time and location
- **Reminders**: Contextual notifications
- **Voice Transcriptions**: Analytics and improvement data
- **AI Prioritizations**: Tracking AI suggestions and feedback

### Enhanced Data Flow
1. User speaks into microphone
2. Audio is recorded using Web Audio API
3. Audio is sent to `/api/transcribe` (OpenAI Whisper)
4. Transcription is sent to `/api/parse` (GPT/Gemini NLP)
5. Structured data is saved via StorageService
6. Contextual reminders are automatically created
7. UI updates with toast notifications and real-time feedback

## Customization

### Design System
The app uses a comprehensive design system with:
- **Colors**: Purple/pink gradients with glass morphism
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and floating elements
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design

### Extending Functionality
- Add more AI providers in `lib/openai.ts`
- Implement backend storage in `lib/storage.ts`
- Add new voice command patterns in the parsing logic
- Integrate with external calendar services
